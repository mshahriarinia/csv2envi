csv2envi.cpp


Overview
--------
The csv2envi program will take a csv file exported from SciDB and generate the
corresponding ENVI binary/header file pair in the specified format: bsq, bil,
or bip.


Exporting Array From SciDB
--------------------------
The SciDB function 'save' exports an array stored in SciDB to one of the
specified formats: csv, csv+, dcsv, dense, lcsv+, lsparse, sparse. This program
only supports conversion from csv to ENVI. See SciDB User Guide for details on
the 'save' function.


Running csv2envi
----------------
To run this program, enter the following in the command line:

./csv2envi inputFilePath outputFilePath lines samples bands
           precision interleave byteOrder

  Arguments         Description
  ---------         -----------
  inputFilePath     Full path to the input csv file.
  outputFilePath    Full path to the ouput ENVI file.
  lines             Number of lines.
  samples           Number of samples.
  bands             Number of bands.
  precision         1 (1-byte unsigned integer)
                    2 (2-byte signed integer)
                    3 (4-byte signed integer)
                    4 (4-byte float)
                    5 (8-byte double)
                    12 (2-byte unsigned integer)
  interleave        bsq (band sequential)
                    bil (band interleave by line)
                    bip (band interleave by pixel)
  byteOrder         0 (little-endian)
                    1 (big-endian)

The command line arguments must correspond to the attributes of the array stored
in SciDB. E.g. if the array you wish to export has 2-byte signed integers stored
in each cell, then you must specify a value of 2 for the precision.

Example Cases
-------------
1. SciDB array 'exportme' is a 3x4x5 dimension array storing 1-byte unsigned
   integers where lines = 3, samples = 4, bands = 5.
   
   Export the array from SciDB to a csv file using the afl command in SciDB:
   save(exportme, '/home/scidb/exportme.csv', -2, 'csv');
   
   Generate a bil file from the csv file:
   csv2envi /home/scidb/exportme.csv /home/scidb/exportme 3 4 5 1 bil 0
   
   This generates 2 files: exportme.bil and exportme.hdr.

   Note: The outputFilePath does not include the extension .bil. If it does,
   the program will strip the extension specified in the outputFilePath.

2. SciDB array 'fielddata' is a 6x3x4 dimension array storing 2-byte signed
   integers where lines = 6, samples = 3, and bands = 5.
   
   Export the array from SciDB to a csv file using the afl command in SciDB:
   save(fielddata, '/home/scidb/fielddata.csv', -2, 'csv');
   
   Generate a bsq file from the csv file:
   csv2envi /home/scidb/fielddata.csv /home/scidb/fielddata 6 3 4 2 bsq 1
   
   This generates 2 files: fielddata.bsq and fielddata.hdr.

   Note: The outputFilePath does not include the extension .bil. If it does,
   the program will strip the extension specified in the outputFilePath.
